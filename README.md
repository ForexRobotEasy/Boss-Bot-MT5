## How It Works

1. The code includes the necessary libraries and global variables.
2. The risk management parameters, such as the risk percentage per trade, stop loss multiplier, and take profit multiplier, are defined as input variables.
3. The `OnInit` function is called during the expert advisor initialization process. It initializes the risk management and performs other initialization tasks.
4. The `OnDeinit` function is called during the expert advisor deinitialization process. It performs cleanup tasks.
5. The `OnTick` function is triggered on every tick and checks for significant shifts in market structure using the BOS strategy.
6. If a break of structure is identified, the `GetEntryPrice`, `CalculateStopLoss`, and `CalculateTakeProfit` functions are called to determine the optimal trading points.
7. The `ExecuteTrade` function is then called to execute the trade using the calculated entry price, stop loss, and take profit.
8. The `InitRiskManagement` function calculates the risk per trade based on the account balance and risk percentage, sets the maximum allowed deviation and slippage for trading operations, and sets the risk per trade for the account.
9. The `IsBreakOfStructure` function contains the logic to check for break of structure. This logic is not provided in the code and should be implemented by the user.
10. The `GetEntryPrice` function calculates the entry price. The logic for this calculation is not provided and should be implemented by the user.
11. The `CalculateStopLoss` function calculates the stop loss based on the entry price and risk management parameters.
12. The `CalculateTakeProfit` function calculates the take profit based on the entry price and risk management parameters.
13. The `ExecuteTrade` function executes the trade using the calculated entry price, stop loss, and take profit.

Please note that the provided code is a template and requires customization to implement the specific break of structure strategy and trading logic desired by the user.
